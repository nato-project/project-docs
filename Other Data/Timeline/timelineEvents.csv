18-Feb-14,Maidan Protest Violence Peaks,"Thousands of protestors clashed with police in Kiev in Ukraine’s bloodiest 48 hours since World War II. Some 88 people were killed and hundreds more wounded as protestors marched on the Ukrainian Parliament, or Rada, and security forces attempted to clear out Independence Square.

The escalation in violence occurred amid reports that the Rada had stalled when considering the restoration of Ukraine’s 2004 Constitution. Security officials warned that police forces would be authorized to use live ammunition to quell the protests. The two sides accused one another of using sniper fire against unarmed civilians.

American and European leaders called on Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych to deescalate the situation and withdraw security forces immediately, while also stating that they would not hesitate to sanction individual officials responsible for the violence. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin stressed that Ukraine must take “urgent measures to stabilize the situation and suppress extremist and terrorist attacks.”",,,
21-Feb-14,"Yanukovych Reportedly Flees Kyiv, Tensions Remain","Late Friday evening, the U.S. Department of State confirmed reports that Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych has fled Kyiv following the signing of a settlement agreement. While it is unclear exactly where Yanukovych is now, the Department of State believes him to have traveled to eastern Ukraine in order to “shore up support there.” Other reports indicated that Yanukovych had departed Ukraine altogether, possibly for Russia.

While Yanukovych and opposition leaders reached an agreement to end the crisis in Kyiv on Friday, media reports indicate that a portion of the demonstrators on the Maidan were unwilling to accept less than Yanukovych’s full ouster. Addressing the crowd, opposition leader Vitali Klitschko urged protestors to accept the deal, but he was drowned out by shouts of “shame!” He was then interrupted by a militant opposition figure who stated that if Yanukovych does not resign, “we will go with weapons.” A leader of the Right Sector, an ultranationalist group, stated that “the agreements that were reached do no correspond to our aspirations. Right Sector will not lay down arms.”",,,
27-Feb-14,Crimean Parliament Sets Referendum as Ukrainian Government Vows to Prevent Break-Up,"Crimean Parliament Speaker Vladimir Konstantinov announced that parliamentary deputies were preparing a referendum “on the widening of the authority of the autonomous republic of Crimea.” Mr. Konstantinov did not clarify exactly what the referendum would consider, though he had said only yesterday that secession from Ukraine was not under consideration. Nevertheless, Mr. Konstantinov stressed that the Crimean Parliament was the only remaining legitimate authority in the peninsula, and questioned the new Ukrainian government’s commitment to Crimea.

The referendum announcement follows days of turmoil in the Crimean Peninsula in response to the Euromaidan protests in Kiev. Today, thousands of Crimeans demonstrated in favor of a closer relationship with Russia, shouting “Putin is our President.” Other protestors stormed and occupied Sevastopol’s government buildings, including the Parliament, and removed their Ukrainian flags.

Outside Crimea, Russian officials pledged support for “ greater federalism ” in Ukraine while Western officials expressed concern over the growing unrest in Crimea and condemned the armed takeover of official buildings.",,,
28-Feb-14,Russian Forces Occupy Strategic Facilities in Crimea,"Early on Friday, several hundred unidentified armed men in military uniforms carrying military weapons took control of the airport in Simferopol and a military airport in Sevastopol.

Throughout the day, other strategic locations were seized by similar troops, including the headquarters of the “Krym” State Television Company and several facilities owned by Urktelecom, which is responsible for the majority of telephone and internet communications on the peninsula. Russia military vehicles have begun to show up in Crimea, according to reports. Local militias reportedly supported the unidentified troops as well and, according to Ukraine’s Interior Minister, no violence was reported on the peninsula.

Initially, a statement from the Russian Black Sea Fleet denied allegations that troops from the base in Sevastopol were involved. However, the Russian Foreign Ministry later informed the Ukrainian government that it had moved units from its base in Sevastopol into Crimea proper to “protect fleet positions.” The Foreign Ministry statement also noted that Russia had denied a Ukrainian request for bilateral consultations on the basis that events in Crimea are “the result of recent internal political processes in Ukraine.” Russian Ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, assured the international community that any movement by Russian troops was “within the framework” of Russia’s agreement with Ukraine on the base at Sevastopol.",,,
6-Mar-14,"Crimean Parliament Votes to Secede From Ukraine, Join Russia","In a quick vote held behind closed doors, the regional Parliament of Crimea has voted to secede from Ukraine and join Russia. While some MPs have questioned the legitimacy of the vote on the basis that some MPs were not allowed to participate, Crimea has asked the Russian leadership to “launch the procedure of Crimea becoming part of Russia.” Crimea is set to create new government ministries independent from Kyiv and has announced plans to nationalize all state-owned enterprises. The referendum on Crimea’s status has also been pushed forward to March 16, though Crimea’s Tatar population has called for a boycott.

Crimea’s de-facto Prime Minister, Sergey Aksyonov, is unwilling to negotiate with the interim Ukrainian government in Kyiv, stating that “we do not consider this government that proposes talks to us to be legitimate.” Aksyonov’s deputy, Rustam Temugaliyev, stated in an interview that members of the Ukrainian military in Crimea would need to either surrender, accept postings in the Russian military, along with Russian citizenship, or leave Crimea.

Armed men seized the television and radio station in Simferopol today, turning off the Ukrainian channels and replacing them with Rossiya 24, a Russian news channel. Russia also put into place a blockade of Ukrainian warships in Novoozerne, Donuzlav Lake and started massive air defense drills less than 300 miles from the Ukrainian border.",,,

Only 3.2 percent favored a return to autonomous status within Ukraine. A Crimean official stated that by the time polls closed, more than 80 percent of eligible voters had cast their ballots.

The ballot read: “Do you support reunifying Crimea with Russia as a subject of the Russian Federation? Do you support the restoration of the 1992 Crimean constitution and the status of Crimea as a part of Ukraine?” There was no option for those who wanted to maintain the status quo. The official website of the referendum noted that more than 200 voting precincts and 1,700 observers were in operation during the vote.",,,
18-Mar-14,"Ukrainian Navy HQ in Crimea Overtaken, Rear Admiral Detained","Approximately 300 Crimean “self-defense” forces, possible aided by Russian military personnel, seized the headquarters of the Ukrainian Navy in Sevastopol and another naval base today, raising the Russian flag.

Prime Minister Yatsenyuk sent First Deputy Prime Minister Vitaliy Yarema and Defense Minister Ihor Tenyukh to Crimea on Wednesady. However, they cancelled the trip after Crimean Prime Minister Sergey Aksyonov stated that they “are not welcome.”",,,
22-Mar,Pro-Russian Protestors Rally in Donetsk,"Thousands of protestors gathered in the eastern Ukrainian city of Dontesk on Saturday to protest in favor of greater autonomy within Ukraine for the eastern regions, the return of former President Viktor Yanukovych to power, early local and regional elections, and even a referendum on the future of the eastern region. According to press reports, many of the demonstrators carried Russian flags and chanted “Russia” and “Crimea! Donbass! Russia!”

The local parliament in the Donbass region, which includes Donetsk, began discussions aimed at pushing for a referendum similar that which occurred in Crimea and protestors faced off with riot police.

Russia has publicly supported the adoption of a federal constitution in Ukraine that would give the eastern regions greater economic and political autonomy. Moscow has also supported policies that would guarantee Ukraine’s “political and military neutrality.”

Local prosecutors in Donetsk have also opened criminal investigations against a number of pro-Russian activists. The charges include “hooliganism and massive disorders by a group of people” tied to protests in Donestk earlier in March.",,,
23-Mar-14,"Protests in Eastern Ukraine Continue, Intensify","Protests continued in many eastern Ukrainian cities on Sunday. For the second day in a row, pro-Russia, anti-Western protestors congregated on Lenin Square in Donetsk in support of a referendum to join the Russian Federation. According to a study undertaken in February by the Democratic Initiatives Foundation in Ukraine, 33.2 percent of the population in Donestk favor union with Russia.

1-Apr-14,NATO Suspends Cooperation with Russia,"Following a meeting of the NATO foreign ministers in Brussels on Tuesday, NATO announced that it will “suspend all practical civilian and military cooperation” with Russia. This measure will be accompanied by other steps to improve the security of NATO member states.

These include: the “possible deployment and reinforcement of military assets in eastern NATO members;” “a possible increase of readiness levels for the NATO rapid response force;” and “a possible review of NATO’s crisis response plans.” A statement from the NATO foreign ministers also outlined measures to “intensify cooperation” with Ukraine and help Ukraine “provide for its own security,” though it did not mention possible Ukrainian accession to NATO.

6-Apr-14,Pro-Russian Crowds Storm Government Buildings in eastern Ukraine,"In Donetsk, several hundred of pro-Russian activists rushed into the seat of the regional government and demanded that deputies of the Donetsk Oblast vote to authorize a referendum on allowing the ""Donetsk Republic"" to join Russia. The separatist organization Donbas Peoples’ Uprising claimed responsibility for the takeover. Witnesses reported seeing “people bringing car tires to be used as barricades against any presumed attempt by authorities to retake the building.”

In Luhansk, hundreds of separatists surrounded the regional security service office (SBU). Luhansk police reported that the protestors broke into an armory room and seized some guns. The amount of guns is unknown.

12-Apr-14,Pro-Russian Forces Seize Additional Facilities,"Pro-Russian forces took control of security facilities in more eastern Ukrainian cities on Saturday despite a call by the government for an end to such actions on Friday evening. Buildings, and in some cases weapons, were seized in Slovyansk, Kramatorsk, and Druzkovka, while an additional attack was turned back in Krasny Liman and unrest in Donetsk continued.

The armed men professed support for greater autonomy for southeastern Ukraine and for referenda on the status of these regions. In Donetsk, forces reportedly wearing the uniforms of the Berkut seized the police headquarters and forced the resignation of the police chief.

Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov stated that “our response will be very severe. There is zero tolerance for armed terrorists.” The Ukrainian government held an emergency meeting of the National Defense and Security Council and Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsia reached out to his counterpart in Moscow, Sergey Lavrov. In that conversation, he called for an end to these “provocative actions” directed by Russia against Ukraine, a charge that Moscow denies.",,,
15-Apr-14,"Ukrainian Military, Pro-Russian Forces Clash as “Anti-Terrorist Operation” Begins","The Ukrainian military has begun “anti-terrorist operations” in eastern Ukraine to oust pro-Russian forces who have occupied government buildings and security facilities in recent days and weeks. Ukrainian soldiers took back an occupied military airbase located near the town of Kramatorsk in an assault involving both air and ground forces.

One Russian news channel reported between 4 and 11 deaths, while Ukraine has said there were no casualties. ITAR-TASS, the Russian state news agency, reported that a fighter jet (likely Ukrainian) was shot down during the fighting. A Ukrainian military officer stated that Ukrainian forces engaged “fighters in green military uniforms without insignia” at the airfield. This description matches that of the Russian troops that seized Crimea weeks ago.

According to a member of the pro-Russian forces, Ukrainian forces have not taken back Kramatorsk itself, but rather only the airbase, portending future conflict. Reuters has reported that attempts by military officials to placate or reason with crowds in Kramatorsk proper were unsuccessful. General Gennady Krutov was forced to withdraw with his men after a crowd shouting “Hands off the Donbass” became heated. It has also been reported that Ukrainian military forces “including troops and armored vehicles,” as well as helicopters, have surrounded the town of Slovyansk, where pro-Russian separatists seized buildings on Saturday. Pro-Russian protestors also seized a government building in Mariupol, another eastern Ukrainian city.

Interim Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov stated in an address to Parliament that “soon there will be no terrorists left in Donetsk or any other region [in Ukraine],” though he did note that the offensive would be “phased, responsible and balanced.” He went on to say that “the purpose of the actions […] is to protect the citizens of Ukraine.” Ukrainian National Security Council Chief Andiry Parubiy tweeted that self-defense forces from the protests on the Maidan in Kyiv were being sent to eastern Ukraine as part of the Ukrainian National Guard. Yurii Klymenko, Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United Nations, stated that Russia’s goal is to disrupt talks between Russia, the EU, the United States, and Ukraine set for Thursday. According to Klymenko, “we are not going to discuss federalization of Ukraine. This issue is not on the agenda.”",,,
20-Apr-14,Photographic Evidence of Russian Military in Eastern Ukraine,"The New York Times today published a series of photographs provided by the Ukrainian government to the OSCE that point towards direct Russian military involvement in eastern Ukraine. The photographs offer compelling comparisons between confirmed images of Russian military forces and photographs of “self-defense forces” in eastern Ukraine. In some cases, the photographs point to the presence of specific individuals in both eastern Ukraine and, for example, Russia’s 2008 war with Georgia; in others, the striking similarity in terms of equipment is highlighted. One Russian military intelligence operative, Igor Ivanovich Strelkov, was identified specifically by the Ukrainian government as being active in eastern Ukraine.

The U.S. Department of State has called the photographic evidence “convincing.” Speaking on Sunday following the publication of the images, State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki stated that “there has been broad unity in the international community about the connection between Russia and some of the armed militants in eastern Ukraine, and the photos presented by the Ukrainians last week only further confirm this, which is why U.S. officials have continued to make that case.”

24-Apr-14,"Clashes Reported in Mariupol, Slovyansk, and Artemivsk","According to Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, Ukrainian forces have taken back the city hall in the Black Sea town of Mariupol from pro-Russian separatists as part of renewed “anti-terrorist operations.” Separatist forces had held the building for nearly two weeks.

Other reports have contradicted Avakov’s claim. A spokesperson for the Mariupol Police indicated that “about 30 masked men armed with baseball bats stormed the [city hall] in the early hours on Thursday and started beating the protesters” and that negotiations with those pro-Russian forces still inside the building were ongoing. Another report indicated that separatists are likely to remain in control of the city hall building.

Fighting between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian militants outside Slovyansk resulted in the deaths of “up to five” separatists, according to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry. The clashes broke out as Ukrainian security forces, using both armored personnel carriers and air support, attacked three highway checkpoints outside the city. Reportedly, the Ukrainian troops have now withdrawn, though the pro-Russian forces had first abandoned the checkpoints. A spokesperson for the pro-Russian leadership in Slovyansk indicated that only two of their forces were killed, one by sniper fire.

Interim President Oleksandr Turchynov announced that Ukrainian forces repelled an attack from nearly 100 pro-Russian forces on a military base in Artemivsk, which lies to the north of Donetsk. Turchynov stated that “the attackers were repelled and suffered significant losses.”

Simon Ostrovsky, the journalist with Vice News, who was being held by pro-Russian forces in Slovyansk since early this week, has been freed",,,
28-Apr-14,"Kharkiv Mayor Shot as Tensions Continue to Rise in Donetsk Region
","At midday local time, Gennady Kernes, the mayor of the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, was shot in the back in an apparent assassination attempt. Following a successful surgery, Kernes is in critical condition and one local official stated that he is “fighting for his life.”

Before the protests on the Maidan, Kernes had been a staunch ally of the Yanukovych government. However, in recent months he had forged a positive relationship with the authorities in Kyiv and directed Kharkiv’s local police forces to retake, in some cases successfully, government buildings seized by pro-Russian forces. Interim Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov ordered an investigation into the shooting, though no official has yet stated which individuals or groups are suspected in the attack.

Elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, a pro-Ukraine protest in Donetsk erupted into violence when it was attacked by a group of secessionists, resulting in dozens of injuries. Reportedly, “baseball bat-wielding militants wearing ‘People’s Republic of Donetsk’ shirts” and some others dressed in fatigues attacked the rally using fire-crackers, at least one stun grenade, and other implements of violence. Militants also captured a City Council building in the city of Konstantinovka. Neither the local police nor local residents made any effort to stop them from doing so.

In a phone call with U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu stated unequivocally that Russian forces will not invade Ukraine. According to a Pentagon readout of the conversation, Hagel pressed his Russian counterpart on Russian role in escalating the crisis and supporting secessionist forces, while also asking for Russia to assist in securing the release of seven military monitors currently being held in Slovyansk.

According to the Russian delegation to the OSCE, Moscow is prepared to “discuss the military aspects surrounding the crisis in Ukraine with the framework of the Forum for Security and Cooperation and its working bodies, as well as through bilateral meetings.” The statement went on to say that the discussions should focus on “an immediate end to the active phase of the Kiev regime’s deadly punitive operation against resident of southeastern Ukraine.”",,,
29-Apr-14,Separatism Continues in Eastern Ukraine,"In Luhansk, pro-Russian separatists opened fire on a police station on Tuesday after seizing the regional government headquarters. Following the clashes, pro-Moscow activists took the headquarters of the government of the Luhansk region and gained control of the regional prosecutor's office and television headquarters.

In Slovyansk, separatists are preparing for a referendum. Authorities in eastern Ukraine’s Slovyansk have ordered the printing of ballots in preparation for an upcoming referendum on the future of the region. According to a spokesman, the ballots for the May 11 referendum will ask voters if they support the April 7 declaration of independence of the Donetsk People’s Republic, a self-proclaimed state in eastern Ukraine. The Slovyansk city council also approved the formation of an official local militia, expected to be formed from the current self-defense forces.",,,
2-May-14,Nearly 40 Die as Clashes Explode in Odessa,"Between 30 and 45 pro-Russian activists died after a fire engulfed the Trade Union building in Odessa following a series of clashes between pro-Moscow and pro-Kyiv protesters on Friday. It was the deadliest day in Ukraine since the height of the fighting between government forces and protesters on the Maidan in late February. According to a Washington Post report, pro-Kyiv demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails at the Trade Unions building where a portion of the pro-Russian mob had taken shelter. An Interfax-Ukraine report listed the death toll at 43; other sources reported tsimilar figures.

Elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, government forces once again attempted to clear Slovyansk of pro-Russian separatists. Following a full day of clashes, the Ukrainian military had won some small victories, “capturing and holding separatist checkpoints and posting infantry and armored vehicles on a bridge overlooking rail lines by the city’s southern border.” Two Ukrainian helicopters were shot down by pro-Russian forces, resulting in the deaths of both pilots; otherwise, casualties around Slovyansk appear to have been relatively light. The Ukrainian military asserts that a Russian surface-to-air missile was used to shoot down the helicopters, bolstering the case that the Russian military is actively supplying the separatists or may be militarily involved in eastern Ukraine.",,,
13-May-14,"Seven Ukrainian Soldiers Killed, More Wounded in Separatist Ambush","On Tuesday, an armored column of the Ukrainian military was ambushed by pro-Russian forces in Oktyabrski, about 20 km southwest of Kramatorsk. According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, seven soldiers died and up to eight others were wounded (. A statement from the ministry read: “Our soldiers were attacked in an ambush. Terrorists attacked our land troops with grenades. The attackers were more than 30 people and set an ambush near the river.” It was the largest loss of life for the Ukrainian military in a single clash with separatists since the beginning of fighting in eastern Ukraine.

In a separate incident, the “People’s Governor” of Luhansk, Valeriy Bolotov, survived an apparent assassination attempt. It is not clear who was behind the attack.

In an attempt to discredit President Putin’s claim that Russia had withdrawn its troops from the border with Ukraine, the U.S. government and NATO have released a series of satellite images that it says disprove Putin’s assertion. According to a NATO spokesperson, “the reality is that Russia continues to have 40,000 high readiness troops massed on Ukraine's border and another 25,000 troops in Crimea. The units on the latest satellite pictures show mechanised infantry, armoured vehicles and combat helicopters.”",,,
22-May-14,"14 Dead, More Wounded Following Clashes with Rebels near Donetsk, Luhansk","Clashes with pro-Russian separatist forces in eastern Ukraine resulted in the deaths of at least 14 Ukrainian military personnel.

Another Ukrainian soldier was killed in clashes near the town of Rubizhne, outside of Luhansk. Reportedly, “civilian provocateurs” – which some have called human shields – blocked a bridge while pro-Russian forces opened fire. Ukrainian forces were also able to prevent at least 60 armed men from reaching the city of Svatovo, in the Luhansk region, by train. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry also released a statement condemning efforts by provocateurs from Russia to enter Ukraine in order to destabilize the country “with the full connivance of the Russian authorities and unlawful inactivity by Russian border guards.”

Rebel leaders in the so-called People’s Republic of Luhansk have decided to impose martial law. Reportedly, they are doing so in response to the activities of government troops in the region. According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Energy, rebels in the Luhansk region seized four coal mines near the Russian border and are demanding that employees supply them with explosives.",,,

However, after two days of conflict, the Ukrainian military has taken back the airport after it was seized by separatists early Monday morning.

The Ukrainian armed forces have now stated that if separatists in Donetsk do not vacate their headquarters, they will use “precision-guided weaponry” to force them out. Denis Pushilin, one of the separatist leaders, stated that “at the moment the situation is very tense, with a lot of threats from Kiev.”

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned against a further escalation, calling it a “colossal mistake.” Newly-elected president of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko has stated that he will ask the United States for military aid in light of the threat posed by the separatists and by Russia.",,,

At least five pro-Russian fighters died (eight wounded). No border officers died, though seven were injured. The Ukrainian military has reportedly provided air support to the border station.

According to a spokesperson for the Ukrainian border service, “they want to clear the way to the border [with Russia]. If they capture that building, they control all the posts along the border.” In recent weeks, the porous Russian border has allowed pro-Russian forces to bring in additional fighters and reinforcements with, as Ukrainian officials have argued, the complicity of the Russian border guard.",,,
10-Jun-14,"Pro-Russian Forces, Military Clash Near Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, Luhansk","Fighting continued unabated in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday, with clashes in Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, and Luhansk.

An attack on an army position outside of Slovyansk resulted in the deaths of two Ukrainian military personnel, while rebels also targeted military positions in and around the airport in Luhansk as well.

A report from the Daily Beast outlined the toll of fighting in Slovyansk on the civilian population. Reportedly, approximately 40 percent of the population has fled the city since the beginning of military operations targeting separatists earlier this month.

Spokespeople for the rebels have acknowledged heavy losses. Igor Strelkov, a rebel commander, stated that “we beat off the first attack and destroyed one tank.

The latest report from the Office of the President of Ukraine claims that the blue and yellow national flag is now flying over the towns of Artemivsk and Druzhkivka. Artemivsk and Druzhkivka are smaller cities, and less tactically important than Slovyansk, but represent an important shift in the ATO’s momentum.

“My order is now in effect - tighten the ring around the terrorists” tweeted President Poroshenko earlier today as the military prepares its siege of Donetsk, the insurgent’s final major redoubt. Donetsk is a considerably larger city than Slovyansk and will be a serious challenge for the Ukranian military. Rebel forces throughout the region, including insurgent commander Igor Strelkov, have retreated to Donetsk to dig in. Rebel forces are preparing for a bitter siege as evidenced by the self-proclaimed Governor Pavel Gubarev who declared “we will drown these wretches in blood.”",,,

A Ukrainian national security spokesman stated that Ukrainian forces were outside the town of Horlivka, just north of the regional center of Donetsk. If the town of Horlivka falls, Ukrainian forces will have open access to the regional capital – Donetsk - and the separatist headquarters located therein. Government forces have blocked roads in and out of Donetsk to prevent insurgents from resupplying. Fearing a violent battle as Ukrainian forces close in on the city, citizens of Donetsk are fleeing the city in droves. Cars jammed roadways heading south out of the city on Saturday.

The continued fighting rages not far from the crash site of MH 17 and comes merely a week after the tragic event. An international team of investigators have had difficulties securing the crash site as bureaucratic tape hinders their ability to enter the region. According to the head of the investigation team, the delay was needed to give the Ukrainian Parliament time to vote and provide a “legal basis” for the deployment of foreign police officers on Ukrainian territory. Bodies of those aboard MH 17 continued arriving in the Netherlands on transport aircraft as announcements were made that forensic experts had officially identified the first victim.",,,
7-Aug-14,Casualties Mount in Donetsk as Rebel Stronghold is Besieged,"The city of Donetsk is home to one of the last pockets of resistance mustered by pro-Russian insurgents. As the forces of the Ukrainian Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO) close in, heavy artillery fire has driven the residents of the city indoors and claimed at least 4 peoples’ lives. Mortar fire and artillery shells struck a hospital as well as several residential areas in downtown Donetsk, both of which were near rebel artillery positions firing on ATO forces. Russian officials have warned that the area is on the brink of a humanitarian disaster. The rebels' situation is growing increasingly desperate, and fractures have begun to emerge in the ranks as self-proclaimed Prime Minister Aleksandr Borodai quits his office.

NATO officials have stated that they have deep concerns about Russia’s escalation of the conflict. One spokesman noted the possibility of Russia using “the pretext of a humanitarian or peace-keeping mission as an excuse to send troops into eastern Ukraine”. The West continues to stand behind Ukraine, with NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen pledging NATO’s support for Kiev. Canada has followed suit by providing non-lethal assistance to Ukraine, including a shipment of helmets, flak jackets, and first-aid kits. Meanwhile, Kiev’s Maidan Square was the scene of violent protests today in a grim reminder of the winter demonstrations that ousted Viktor Yanukovich. Volunteer workers trying to clear the barricades and tents were confronted by angry protestors before police attempted to disperse the crowd.",,,
17-Aug-14,Ukrainian Forces Push into Lugansk and Donetsk,"Ukraine’s Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO) forces have recaptured the Zhovtnevy neighborhood in Lugansk, raising the blue-and-yellow flag over its police station. The same day, ATO soldiers reported that they had liberated the strategic village of Yasynuvata northeast of Donetsk. Lugansk and the surrounding area is suspected to be the conduit to the Russian border from where the insurgents receive most of their supplies, and they are fighting a desperate battle to retain control of the area. Rebel forces are still reaping a bloody toll as evidenced by an ATO MiG-29 fighter jet shot down over Lugansk.

Meanwhile, Ukraine has acknowledged that the 260 truck convoy from Russia is indeed carrying humanitarian aid; however delays persist over “basic technical details.” Additionally, the foreign ministers of Ukraine, Russia, Germany, and France met in Berlin to discuss “restarting the political process” to find a diplomatic conclusion to the Ukrainian Crisis.",,,
5-Sep-14,Cease-Fire Announced in Ukraine,"Following meetings in Minsk, Belarus between representatives of the Ukrainian government and the pro-Russian separatist forces, President Petro Poroshenko announced that a cease-fire has been reached in Ukraine. It is set to go into effect within hours at 6PM local time. The full details of the agreement have not yet been released, though reports indicate that the agreement consists of 14 points covering a range of issues including exchange of hostages, the creation of a humanitarian corridor, and other issues. According to reports, the exchange of captives is likely to begin tomorrow and a working group will meet on Monday to work through other issues relevant to the agreement, most importantly the political issues at place in eastern Ukraine.

In a statement, President Poroshenko said: “The entire world strives for peace, the entire Ukraine strives for peace, including millions of Donbas residents. The highest value is human life. We must do everything possible and impossible to terminate bloodshed and put an end to people's suffering.”

While Poroshenko stated that it is his hope that the cease-fire is observed by all sides, continued fighting around the port city of Mariupol and the comments of some rebel leaders have drawn the stability of the cease-fire into question. Igor Plotnitsky, a rebel leader in the Luhansk region, stated that “the ceasefire does not mean the end of (our) policy to split (from Ukraine).”",,,
6-Sep-14,Shelling of Mariupol Reportedly Resumes Despite Ceasefire,"Despite a ceasefire agreement signed yesterday, reports indicated that shelling resumed late Saturday night around the port city of Mariupol, which has been at the center of intense fighting in recent weeks. Witnesses indicated heavy explosions on the eastern outskirts of Mariupol and a BBC correspondent indicated that shelling ended between Saturday night and Sunday morning. Despite these purported violations of the ceasefire, both President Poroshenko and President Putin stated that the ceasefire is largely holding and expressed support for making it permanent in nature.",,,
20-Sep-14,Large Explosions in Donetsk after Buffer Zone Agreement,"During the “contact group” meeting in Minsk on Saturday representatives from Kiev and Moscow signed a new agreement with Pro-Russian separatists to create a 30 kilometer buffer zone and move artillery 15 kilometers from the front line on both sides, according to a Reuters report.

NATO General Philip Breedlove said he was “hopeful” about the new agreement, but added that the ceasefire was “in name only”. “The number of events, and the number of rounds fired and the artillery used across the past few days match some of the pre-ceasefire levels.”

The New York Times reported that just hours after the agreement in Minsk a dynamite factory in Donetsk was struck, causing two powerful explosions. The artillery strike was not a violation of the new agreement, however, because of a 24-hour grace period for implementation.",,,
4-Oct-14,Fighting Over Airport Kills 12 Separatists,"According to Ukrainian military officials, continued fighting over and around the Donetsk airport killed at least 12 pro-Russian separatist fighters on Saturday, adding to the rising death toll that poses a threat to the stability of the month-old ceasefire. Reportedly, the pro-Russian separatists attempted to storm the airport on Saturday, resulting in the casualties, though reports are unclear about to what degree the military remains in control of the airport.

Military spokesperson Andriy Lysenko stated that, “the airport of Donetsk remains the priority target for terrorists... twelve [separatists] were killed during the attacks and that is the biggest single loss among rebels since September 5,” the day the ceasefire was signed. Lysenko also deflected claims that the separatists had used gas as part of their assault, as had been reported in local media.",,,
26-Oct-14,Ukraine Elects New Parliament,"In elections broadly considered to have been free and fair, Ukrainians have voted strongly in favor of a pro-Russian reform agenda, granting electoral victories to President Petro Poroshenko’s bloc and the People’s Front headed by Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk. President Poroshenko, speaking in a statement, stated that “I asked you to vote for a democratic, reformist, pro-Ukrainian and pro-European majority. Thank you for having heard and supported this appeal.”

Poroshenko’s bloc took approximately 23 percent of the vote with People’s Front close behind with 21 percent. Another pro-Western political party, Self Reliance, took just over 13 percent. According to early exit polling, four other parties would clear the 5 percent hurdle necessary to enter parliament: the Opposition Bloc (7.6 percent), the Radical Party (6.4) led by Oleh Lyashko, Svoboda(6.3), and Fatherland (5.6) led by Yulia Tymoshenko.

According to reports, Poroshenko’s bloc, the People’s Front, and Self Reliance have begun talks on the creation of what President Poroshenko’s spokesperson called a “powerful democratic coalition in parliament.” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Russia would recognize the results of the election, expressing hopes that Russia can work with the new government. He did note, however, that “this election took place, though not on all of Ukraine’s territory.""",,,
2-Nov-14,Separatists Hold Elections in Eastern Ukraine,"Voters in the separatist-controlled portions of eastern Ukraine went to the polls today for elections just a week after Ukraine elected a new parliament. According to the tallies released by the rebels, Aleksandr Zakharchenko, the Prime Minister of the self-proclaimed People’s Republic of Donetsk, will remain in power after winning 78 percent of the vote. Igor Plotnitsky, his counterpart in Luhansk, also retained his position, winning approximately 63 percent.

The European Union denounced the elections as “illegal and illegitimate” and an “obstacle on the path towards peace.” Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko outlined Ukraine’s opposition to the vote, calling it a “farce” that stood in violation of the ceasefire agreement signed in Minsk. Russia, for its part, applauded the election and promised to respect the will of the people in the rebel-held regions.",,,
2-Dec-14,Donetsk Ceasefire Chances Dashed by Renewed Fighting,"While earlier today it was reported that pro-Russian rebels would reach a ceasefire with the Ukrainian military in Donetsk oblast, as they did in Luhansk, renewed fighting around the Donetsk airport has dashed hopes for such an agreement. According to the Ukrainian military, pro-Russian rebels with the support of Russian special forces began shelling government troops near the Donetsk airport despite an agreement in principle on a ceasefire that was reached earlier in the day. The military says that it continues to hold the airport despite an assault that has led to “heavy fighting” at the old terminal, according to military spokesperson Andriy Lysenko.",,,
13-Jan-15,"Fighting in Donetsk Intensifies, Shelling Kills 11","In recent days, the battle over the Donetsk airport and the broader Donetsk area has intensified and a stray artillery shell brought with it a reminder of the immense human toll of the conflict. Ukrainian authorities placed the blame for an artillery attack on a passenger bus, which led to at least 12 civilian deaths, on separatist forces. President Petro Poroshenko stated that “these deaths are on the conscience of the DNR and LNR gangs and on those who stand behind them,” referring to the People’s Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, as well as their Russian supporters.

The artillery attack came just as negotiations in Berlin, which sought to end the crisis diplomatically, reached a stalemate and a planned summit meeting in Astana, Kazakhstan was shelved.",,,
22-Jan-15,Bus Stop Shelling Kills 13 People in Donetsk,"13 people were killed and many injured early in the morning as a result of a shelling of a bus stop in Donetsk. Although information about the number of victims varies, officials say that 12 of the victims were the passengers of a public trolleybus, and the thirteenth victim was found in a nearby vehicle. The attacked bus stop is located 20 kilometers away from Donetsk airport, where violent clashes took place forcing government troops to retreat from the area to avoid further casualties.

The attack followed the earlier efforts of the Normandy Format foreign ministers to reestablish ceasefire along the contact line, noted by the Minsk peace plan. Pro-Russian separatists, currently holding control over Donetsk, blamed government troops for the attack. The allegation was rejected by the Ukrainian military, as its forces were too far to be able to hit the bus stop . Russia’s Foreign Ministry blamed Kiev for the attack and called it a “crude provocation aimed at sabotaging efforts to reach a peaceful solution to the Ukrainian crisis.” Prime Minister Arseniy Yantenyuk, on the other hand, called the shelling “a horrible act against humanity,” committed by separatists. Although rebel forces denied their involvement, they provided conflicting information regarding the initiation place of the attack, which OSCE experts identified to be from northwestern direction.",,,
24-Jan-15,Rebels Reportedly Renew Focus on Mariupol,"A recent rash of shelling in and around the port city of Mariupol today has many, both in Ukraine and around the world, concerned about a possible expansion of the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Rebel leader Alexander Zakharchenko, who a day earlier formally pulled out of peace talks, stated that a new “offensive against Mariupol” was underway, calling it “the best possible monument to all our dead.” He refused, however, to take responsibility for shelling in Mariupol that killed at least 30 and injured nearly 100 more.

Analysts argue that Mariupol is a key strategic objective for any Russian and/or rebel strategy meant to establish a land-bridge between Russia proper and the annexed Crimean peninsula. Mariupol lies only miles south of Donetsk and around 200 miles along the coast from Crimea (see map at left).

Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko convened his top military advisors today, ending early a trip to Saudi Arabia in order to respond to the rebel assault. Colonel Andriy Lysenko told journalists today that while the rebels “keep increasing the intensity of the situation,” they continue to stop short of “open attacks” against the city. The increase in tensions around Mariupol comes only days after the rebels won a major victory, taking full control of the Donetsk airport, which had been the focal point of the conflict for months.",,,
3-Jan-15,Breaking: Minsk Peace Talks Cancelled,"A round of peace talks scheduled to take place in Minsk today have been cancelled. According to a statement from rebel leader Denis Pushilin, the talks were cancelled due to the unwillingness of representatives from Kyiv to attend. However, Ukrainian representative laid the blame for the cancellation squarely on the rebels, who they said undertook a “cynical terrorist act” intended to disrupt the peace talks.",,,
4-Feb-15,"Report: Ukraine Rebels Capture Vuhlehirsk, Near Debaltseve","A report from Reuters today indicates that pro-Russian rebel forces have captured Vuhlehirsk, a town which lies west of the hotly contested city of Debaltseve. While the Ukrainian military continues to state that the town is contested, reports from the ground showed the rebel forces to be in control.

This apparent setback for Ukraine comes amidst a heated debate in Washington and a host of European capitals over the wisdom of providing lethal defensive aid to Ukraine. Earlier today, Polish Europe Minister Rafal Trzaskowski called on the EU to refrain, stating that “military solutions are completely off the table because we do not want to destabilise the situation any further .”

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden departed for meetings in Munich and Brussels that will take place later this week. The issue of increased security and financial assistance to Ukraine are expected to be high on his agenda.",,,
10-Feb-15,Ukrainian Forces Open New Front Around Mariupol,"The National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine announced early today that it has opened a new front around the port city of Mariupol. A spokesperson for the council stated that its forces have “broken through the enemy defenses and went on the offensive” east along the coast (see map at left), while other reports note that the offensive is primarily being led by the Azov battalion, an all-volunteer paramilitary group.

Elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, the pro-Russian separatist fighters have made a similar push to take the strategic rail hub of Debaltseve, while rocket fire attributed to (but then denied by) the rebels fell in Kramatorsk. The rebels have also stated that they will not cease the fighting until they have gained more territory.",,,
22-Feb-15,"Blast at Kharkiv Peace Rally Leaves Two Dead, 11 Injured","A rally commemorating the first anniversary of the Euromaidan movement in Kharkiv was violently interrupted by the detonation of a suspected improvised explosive device. The explosion, which claimed two lives and left nearly a dozen bystanders seriously injured, prompted a swift response from the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council in the form of a “counterterrorism operation.” Within a matter of hours, Ukrainian authorities had detained four suspects in connection to the act; according to an anonymous source within the Ukrainian SBU security serve, the men allegedly “underwent instruction and received weapons” in the Russian city of Belgorod.",,,
18-Jul-15,Deadly Day in Ukraine as Diplomats Discuss Situation,"Four civilians and one soldier were reported killed in shelling in Ukraine ""following a week of the deadliest fighting in over a month,""as both pro-Russian seperatists and the Ukrainian military accused each other of violating the Minsk cease-fire agreement. While the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has noted that both sides have violated the cease-fire, ""Alexander Zakharchenko, leader of the Donetsk rebels, said Saturday his forces are ready to pull back their tanks and armored vehicles with weapons under 100mm 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) from the front line except in problem areas.""

As the situation deteriorated, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov spoke with his counterparts in the US, Germany, and Ukraine. During his discussions with Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin of Ukraine and Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany, Lavrov called for the ""demilitarisation of the flashpoint Shyrokine village."" When speaking with Secretary of State John Kerry, Lavrov emphasized that Kiev ""cannot simply walk away"" from engaging with Donetsk and Luhansk directly, as he said it pledged to do so in the agreement at Minsk.",,,
10-Aug-15,Heaviest Shelling Since February Reported in Eastern Ukraine,"The Ukrainian military reported that around 400 rebel fighters, supported by tanks and armored personnel carriers, attacked government-held positions near the village of Starohnativka in Donetsk region. ""Thanks to the taken measures, resolute and professional activity of the 72nd mechanized brigade, the enemy was stopped and repelled by two-three kilometers back… Our units have taken key heights, which were previously controlled by terrorist groups. The enemy has suffered considerable casualties and lost military hardware,"" the report said. Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said that over the previous 24 hours one servicemen was killed, one went missing, and 16 were wounded. The rebels denied the attack, accusing Kyiv of carrying out the assault.",,,
16-Aug-15,Shelling Rocks Outskirts of Mariupol,"Fighting is moving gradually closer to the strategically vital port of Mariupol along the Black Sea Coast, as shelling by pro-Russian seperatists struck targets on Sunday night within the village of Sartana, 20 kilometers to Mariupol's east. Two civilians were killed and a young child wounded by the assault.

German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier called the situation in Ukraine “explosive” and warned of a possible “a new military escalation spiral.” Steinmeier made clear that Germany would like to see a return to the peace process by both parties to the conflict as soon as possible.

In other news, a U.S. Department of Defense plan to dramatically expand U.S. drone flights around the world would include an increase in flights over Ukraine, according to reports. Top U.S. military officials with responsibility for Europe, including Philip Breedlove, have lamented the lack of resources dedicated to drones in that part of the world.",,,
31-Aug-15,Rada Backs Decentralization in First Reading as Bombing Injures 100,"During a contentious session marred by protests and a bombing, Ukraine’s parliament voted today in support of the first reading of decentralization legislation that would amend the country’s constitution and devolve significant powers to the pro-Russian regions of eastern Ukraine. The decentralization legislation, which if passed would create a special law on local government in the separatist-controlled regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, has the support of president Petro Poroshenko’s political bloc and much of his government. Volodymyr Hroysman, the speaker of the Rada, stated clearly, however, that it would not constitute “special status” for these regions (a separate law would be needed to determine status). The implementation of some form of decentralization law was a key element of the Minsk II agreement that was negotiated in February.

The decentralization bill passed on its first reading with 265 votes, though Poroshenko will ultimately need the support of 300 legislators to amend the constitution. Many analysts believe that it will be very difficult for Poroshenko to marshal that level of support, especially since some of his coalition allies in Parliament opposed the bill on its first reading.

The vote was accompanied by protests outside of parliament led by nationalist groups (in particular Svoboda) that opposed the decentralization legislation. Following the announcement that the bill passed on its first reading, clashes between police and protestors reportedly escalated and an explosive device was hurled at the police. Approximately 100 members of the police and National Guard were injured, according to the Interior Ministry.",,,
11-Sep-15,No Shelling in Ukraine,"Today was the first day in nearly eighteen months that the shelling in eastern Ukraine was halted completely. Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko noted this figure during his speech today at a security conference in Kyiv, saying that “the cease-fire is in place for almost two week and is not a dream anymore” and that he will continue to push for the Minsk II accord to be implemented fully. It is important to note that, despite the absence of shelling, two Ukrainian soldiers were killed after their patrol struck a mine near Donetsk.",,,
23-Sep-15,"Azov Battalion Storms Kharkiv Town Hall, Clashes with Police","At least 200 alleged members of the nationalist Azov battalion, wearing camouflage and balaclavas, stormed Kharkiv’s main administration building on Wednesday. Clashing with local police, the group called on members to get rid of “accomplices to occupiers” (Kernes) and demanded Dobkin to “go and live in Moscow.""

Tensions arose after pro-Kyiv groups proposed to name a Kharkiv street after the Heavenly Hundred, those killed during the EuroMaidan Revolution. Dobkin, on the other hand, put forward a counter argument calling for a street to be named after the Berkut officers, those allegedly behind the Maidan killings. Kernes had been Kharkiv’s mayor since 2010 and had switched sides from strongly supporting the former pro-Russian President Yanukovich to now supporting the new pro-EU government of Poroshenko.

On another note, Russia is reportedly planning on building a second big military base in Boguchar, Voronezh (45km from the Ukrainian border), and will complement an even closer base that began construction last month in the same area. It is said to be a permanent station that will house 5,000 troops and at least 1,200 armored vehicles and associated maintenance capability and ammunition.",,,
